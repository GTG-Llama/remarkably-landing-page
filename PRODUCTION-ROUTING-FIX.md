# Production SPA Routing Fix for remarkably.ink

## Current Problem
- ✅ **Local (localhost:8080)**: All routes work correctly
- ❌ **Production (remarkably.ink)**: All URLs serve the same homepage content
- ❌ **Specific issue**: `/contact`, `/beta`, and other routes don't work

## Root Cause Analysis
The production nginx server (nginx/1.22.1) is **not configured for Single Page Application routing**. Currently, all routes are falling back to serving the same content instead of letting React Router handle client-side routing.

## Critical Fix Required

### 1. Nginx Configuration Issue
The current nginx config is missing the crucial `try_files` directive for SPA routing:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### 2. Server Details Detected
- **Server**: nginx/1.22.1 
- **IP**: 34.87.46.232
- **SSL**: Enabled with proper headers
- **Issue**: Missing SPA routing configuration

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Apply Nginx Configuration

**Option A: Automatic deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Upload nginx-production.conf and deploy-to-server.sh to your server
# Then run:
sudo ./deploy-to-server.sh
```

**Option B: Manual configuration**
```bash
# Copy the nginx config
sudo cp nginx-production.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/remarkably.ink

# Enable the site
sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/remarkably.ink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Test configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Reload nginx if test passes
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Step 2: Key Configuration Changes

The new nginx config includes:

1. **SPA Routing Fix** (CRITICAL):
   ```nginx
   location / {
       try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
   }
   ```

2. **Static Asset Caching**:
   ```nginx
   location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|mp4)$ {
       expires 1y;
       add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
   }
   ```

3. **Security Headers** (already present but improved)
4. **Error Page Fallback**: All errors redirect to index.html

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

After applying the configuration, test these URLs:
- https://remarkably.ink/contact ← Should show contact page
- https://remarkably.ink/beta ← Should show beta site  
- https://remarkably.ink/beta/features ← Should show features page
- https://remarkably.ink/beta/features/handwriting-recognition ← Should show specific feature

2. **`deploy-to-server.sh`** - Automated deployment script
3. **`PRODUCTION-ROUTING-FIX.md`** - This troubleshooting guide

## Debugging Commands

If routes still don't work after applying the fix:

```bash
# Check nginx error logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Test nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Check if site is enabled
ls -la /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Verify nginx is running
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Test individual routes
curl -I https://remarkably.ink/contact
curl -I https://remarkably.ink/beta
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: 404 Errors
**Cause**: nginx config not applied correctly
**Solution**: Re-run deployment script or manually copy config

### Issue 2: Still Shows Homepage for All Routes
**Cause**: `try_files` directive not working
**Solution**: Check that the root directory path is correct in nginx config

### Issue 3: CSS/JS Not Loading
**Cause**: Incorrect static asset paths
**Solution**: Verify that `root` path in nginx points to correct directory

### Issue 4: SSL Issues
**Cause**: Certificate paths in nginx config
**Solution**: Update SSL certificate paths in nginx-production.conf

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] https://remarkably.ink/ loads homepage
- [ ] https://remarkably.ink/contact loads contact page (not homepage)
- [ ] https://remarkably.ink/beta loads beta site (not homepage)  
- [ ] https://remarkably.ink/beta/features loads features page
- [ ] All CSS and JavaScript files load correctly
- [ ] Browser developer tools show no 404 errors
- [ ] React Router is handling navigation correctly

## Emergency Rollback

If something goes wrong:
```bash
# Restore backup config (if exists)
sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/remarkably.ink.backup* /etc/nginx/sites-available/remarkably.ink

# Or disable the site temporarily
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/remarkably.ink

# Reload nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

The key fix is ensuring that nginx serves `/index.html` for all routes that don't match static files, allowing React Router to handle the routing on the client side.
