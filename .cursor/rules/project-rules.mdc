This is the official B2B marketing site for Remarkably â€” an AI essay grading platform that saves teachers 6â€“7x grading time while maintaining personalized, rubric-aligned feedback.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Build trust with schools, teachers, and administrators.
- Highlight time savings, quality of feedback, and ease of use.
- Show empathy for educators and emphasize mission-driven purpose.
- Use visuals to demonstrate modernity, clarity, and intelligence.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Guidelines
- Use a **light, gradient-inspired theme** (modern/futuristic but approachable).
- Backdrops should include **neural net style patterns**, soft motion, or animated gradients.
- **Hover effects** should create soft spotlight-style glows around mouse movement areas.
- Use gradients for buttons, text highlights, and section dividers.
- Typography should feel elegant and readable: no harsh fonts or all-caps overload.
- Avoid corporate clichÃ©s; instead, make it feel **designed for real teachers**.
## ðŸ§± Layout Strategy
- Sections should be ordered: Hero â†’ Metrics â†’ Supported By â†’ Features â†’ Demo â†’ Testimonials â†’ CTA
- Use **animated counters** for stats (e.g., from 1 to 1M for words graded).
- Showcase:  
  - 6â€“7x faster grading  
  - 1M+ words graded  
  - Thousands of educators reached  
- CTA buttons must stand out and include Framer Motion hover/tap interactions.

## âœ… Must-Haves
- Framer Motion for animations, hover states, and scroll transitions.
- GSAP allowed for advanced motion where needed.
- Gradient overlays and subtle glow effects for polish.
- Every section must scale and align properly at all zoom levels.
- "Supported by" carousel with auto-scroll and fade transitions.

## ðŸš« Avoid
- Overuse of dark themes unless reversed for a specific section.
- Cluttered layout or unnecessary animations.
- Placeholder content or mock features not ready yet.
