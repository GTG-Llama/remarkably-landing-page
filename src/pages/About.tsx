            With backgrounds in education, machine learning, and business, we created Remarkably 
            to solve a real problem: grading hundreds of essays by hand is exhausting, slow, 
            and unsustainable. Our tool brings AI directly into the teacher workflow, especially 
            for handwritten compositions, which most other platforms ignore.
