# QnA

> “Can it actually grade handwritten essays? My students have messy writing.”  
Yes. Our system handles real, messy student handwriting. If it’s unsure, it flags it for review — so you only check what matters.

> “How does it know how I would grade? I don’t want generic AI feedback.”  
Upload a few marked essays — Remarkably learns your tone, style, and feedback habits. It writes like you, not like ChatGPT.

> “How do we know it’s accurate? Can we trust the grades?”  
Yes. You can upload your own rubrics, and Remarkably will grade based on them — not a generic AI standard. You control the criteria.

> “How long does it take to grade a full class?”  
Usually under an hour for 30–40 essays. Most teachers save 20+ hours per round compared to manual marking.

> “Does it work for narrative, discursive, and argumentative essays?”  
Yes. It handles all common essay types and adjusts feedback based on the structure expected.

   Create tiers (e.g., Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor) with specific descriptions for each criterion.

4. **Align with Standards**

# Stress Reduction

**5 Effective Strategies to Reduce Teacher Stress**  
Managing stress helps teachers stay energized, focused, and present in the classroom. Implement these evidence-based techniques to protect your well-being and improve job satisfaction.

1. **Mindful Breathing & Meditation**  
   Spend 5–10 minutes daily on simple mindfulness exercises:  
   - **Deep breathing**: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, exhale 4 seconds (the “4×4” technique).  
   - **Guided meditation**: Use an app or audio guide to center your thoughts and lower cortisol levels.

2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**  
   Systematically tense and release major muscle groups to release physical tension:  
   1. Find a quiet space and sit or lie down.  
   2. Tense one muscle group (e.g., shoulders) for 5 seconds, then relax for 10 seconds.  
   3. Move through arms, legs, torso, and face.

3. **Prioritize & Set Boundaries**  
   Avoid overload by clearly defining work-life limits:  
   - **List daily tasks** and rank by urgency—focus on top priorities first.  
   - **Learn to say “no”** to non-essential requests.  
   - **Block “no-meeting” times** for planning and self-care.

4. **Physical Activity Breaks**  
   Short bursts of movement boost mood and energy:  
   - Take a **5-minute walk** around campus between classes.  
   - Do **desk stretches** or light yoga poses at your desk.  
   - Encourage **laughter breaks** with colleagues.

5. **Peer Support & Reflection**  
   Build a supportive network and practice self-compassion:  
   - **Debrief** weekly with a colleague or mentor—share wins and challenges.  
   - Keep a **“gratitude journal”**: note one positive teaching moment each day.  
   - Treat mistakes as learning opportunities—avoid dwelling on imperfection.
